# Employee Management System (EMS)



> Objective - Create a simplified Employee Management System (EMS). This project will cover control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts to manage employee data.

**Steps to Implement**

Step 1 - Plan the Data Storage
Use a dictionary to store employee data where the keys is the emp_id (Employee ID) and the value is another dictionary containing:

```
name: Employee's name.
age: Employee's age.
department: Employee's department.
salary: Employee's monthly salary.
Initialize the dictionary with some sample employee data for testing (e.g., {101: {'name': 'Satya', 'age': 27, 'department': 'HR', 'salary': 50000}}).
```


Step 2 - Define the Menu System
Create a menu that displays the following options:


Add Employee
View All Employees
Search for Employee
Exit
Implement a loop to continuously display the menu until the user chooses to Exit.



Step 3 - Add Employee Functionality
Prompt the User to enter the following details for a new employee:


emp_id (Employee ID)
name (Employee Name)
age (Employee Age)
department (Employee Department)
salary (Employee Salary)
Validate Input: Make sure the Employee ID is unique. If it already exists in the dictionary, ask the user to enter a new ID.


Store the Employee data in the dictionary using the entered emp_id as the key and the other details as values.


Display a message indicating the employee was successfully added.



Step 4 - View All Employees
Display all employees stored in the dictionary.
Format the display in a table-like structure, showing employee details (ID, name, age, department, salary).
If there are no employees in the system, display a message like:
"No employees available."

Step 5 - Search for an Employee by ID
Prompt the User to enter the emp_id they want to search for.
Search the Dictionary:
If the employee exists, display their details (name, age, department, salary).
If the employee does not exist, display a message like:
"Employee not found."

Step 6 - Exit the Program
Add an Exit option in the menu.
If the user chooses Exit, display a thank-you message and exit the program.

Project Code Structure
To keep the project organized, break it into functions:
main_menu(): Displays the main menu and calls the appropriate function based on user input.
add_employee(): Adds a new employee to the dictionary.
view_employees(): Displays all employee details.
search_employee(): Searches for an employee by ID.
